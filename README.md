# Toddler Animator Website

This is a simple multi-page website for a conceptual 'Toddler Animator' app, designed with HTML and Tailwind CSS to be extremely user-friendly.

## Pages:
- `index.html`: The home page introducing the Toddler Animator concept.
- `app.html`: The interactive 'app' page where users (toddlers!) can add simple shapes to a canvas by tapping buttons. Tapping the canvas clears it.
- `about.html`: Information about the philosophy and features of the Toddler Animator.

## How to View:
1.  Save all the files into a single directory on your computer.
2.  Open any of the `.html` files (e.g., `index.html`) in your web browser.
3.  Navigate between pages using the links in the header.
